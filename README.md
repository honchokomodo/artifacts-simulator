# Artifact Simulator
***Artifact Simulator*** is a tool to generate and calculate when your artifacts in Genshin Impact are *good enough*.

## To Do
- [ ] make a ui
- [ ] abstract weapon buffs, character passives, and artifact set bonuses out to structs
- [ ] get more art
- [ ] enter data for characters, weapons, and artifact sets

## Art contribution guidelines
If you want to help out and contribute art
+ icons are 128 pixels by 128 pixels and front facing
+ portraits are 512 pixels by 512 pixels meant to be more dynamic
+ currently we're keeping the scope at just amber, yoimiya, skirk.
+ to add your drawing, put it in `resources/images/characters`
+ add the file name of your drawing under the [**Artists**](#artists) section below and with your name (you can also add a link to bio)
	+ do a comma separated list of your artwork if it isn't your first time add art (i.e. `a.png, b.png, c.png [name\](link\)`)
